###SO: What can this launcher do for you?

Well, it can do a couple things right now, but this list will likely keep expanding over time. It can:

* Automatically update OpenRCT2 so you are always running the latest build with all the fixes that go with it
* Copy the theme music from Roller Coaster Tycoon 1 into Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 for use in OpenRCT2
* Enable seamless syncing of your saves and progress between multiple computers via Dropbox (Requires Admin to setup, computer with most progress should be added last)
* Launch OpenRCT2 :)

If you find any bugs/want features added, please feel free to file an issue or make a pull request and add it yourself - Just make sure you send back the changes. :)
